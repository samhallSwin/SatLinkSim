# SatLinkSim

SatLinkSim.m - Satellite conection simulator for Matlab SatCom toolbox. Not properly vectorised and runs slow for large scenarios.

SatLinkSimEfficient.m - Properly vectorised version but currently doesn't work....

Walker2TLE.m - Code I stole from somewhere and slightly modified. Creates a Walker Delta swarm and writes a TLE file based on it.

TLEs - WISOTT
